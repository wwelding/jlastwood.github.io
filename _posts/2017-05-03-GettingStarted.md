The initiation and planning phases
of the project begin as soon as you hire your project manager.   This includes establishing what is going to get done, what is the budget, getting the team and 
vendors onboard, establishing the objectives and key deliverables and setup the communication and Project Management  collaboration tools.  

The Project Manager will send a questionnaire to the client, plus have 1 or 2 meetings to gather information about the project.    In 5 to 7 business days the Project Manager will have the project initiated ready for your approval.  Once you approve, we hit the ground running and are ready to start work.

### The client needs to provide:

* Description of your idea or concept.
* Names of any team members that you want us to use and the role/expertise,
* Brand book, logo ideas, fonts, colors for your site or marketing
* Any designs, ideas or graphics you have in mind
* Inspiration sites.  Have you seen this done somewhere else.  What do you like or not like about their ideas.
* The budget including how it is to be allocated.
* The authority of the Project Manager who is acting on your behalf.

### The PM will deliver to the client:

* A Charter which includes:
  * Scope of the project:  What is to be done?
  * Resource plan:  Who are the team members, roles and skills needed for this product?
  * Communication plan:   How will team members communicate, how often, how often will project status reports be delivered to the client?
  * Constraints, Assumptions and Risks:  What is the budget, are there important time constraints or regulatory requirements?
* Business Case (optional)
* Financial Plan:  Overview of budget and planned costs.
* Architecture/planned implementation.  If you have already decided on a solution or technology, then this will be delivered, otherwise a software architect will define this in the next phase or we will proceed with a Proof of Concept or MVP (Minimum Viable Product) project to deliver a few features to test the market/solution.  

### Communication Board

We have a sample Trello board and excel template to setup your project.   We will setup slack, skype, google groups to communicate as per your instructions.  

### Next Step, Execution
  
We are ready to start the project.  Watch out now, things will happen fast now that planning is complete and the 
project manager is communicating, monitoring and mentoring the teams.
